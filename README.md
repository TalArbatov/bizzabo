## Improvements
* Redux as a state-management in this project is an overkill, it could've been done with a lighter alternative such as Context, or without state-management at all.
* Scalability: lots of variables which belong in a config file are accessed directly.
* I chose to work with styled-components as the styling library, all styled components are located in a single file, in a a real-world scenario, it's worth seperating them and thinking about a file structure that is scalable and comfortable as well.
